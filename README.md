## About The Project

A community-driven web app that allows a streamer to vote and sort in a tierlist game characters that are chosen by their community.

## Built With

This project uses the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) as a startup point, it unites the following tools to make the core of the app:

- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
